Small fixes. Testing on the latest WP version.

= 1.0.1 =
Added new functionality that allows you to filter the results as well as group the filtered results. You can use the new shortcode that allows you to do this: [mpg where='' group=''][/mpg]. In the "where" parameter you need to specify the name of the column and the value by which you need to filter. Example: where='mpg_column_name=value' or for multi column filter just use comma like where='mpg_column_name=value, mpg_column_name2=value2,...,mpg_column_name7=value7'. Filtered results can be grouped by the value of any of the columns. Example: group='mpg_column_name'. For filtered data, you can specify your HTML pattern, just insert HTML code inside shortcode like this: [mpg]<p>{{column_name}}</p>[/mpg]. Full example of new shortcode look like: [mpg where='mpg_state=NY' group='mpg_city']<p>{{city}}</p>[/mpg]
